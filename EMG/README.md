### EMG Signal Analysis

This notebook presents the analysis of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded under varying muscle load. The notebook includes signal preprocessing, power estimation, and movement detection. Spectral and time-frequency analyses are performed to investigate the effects of muscle load on EMG signal characteristics. Time-frequency representations are compared using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT).
