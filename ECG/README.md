### ECG Signal Analysis

This notebook presents the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals acquired under different physiological conditions. The analysis includes signal preprocessing, R-peak detection, heart rate (HR) estimation, and heart rate variability (HRV) calculation. Spectral characteristics of HRV are compared across experimental.
