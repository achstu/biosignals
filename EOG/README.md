### EOG Signal Analysis

This notebook presents the analysis of electrooculographic (EOG) signals recorded during controlled eye movements, voluntary and involuntary blinks, and reading. The notebook includes signal preprocessing and time-domain analysis to characterize the EOG response to different eye activities. The effects of high-pass and low-pass filtering are explored. Blink waveforms are aligned and compared to assess their repeatability and to investigate differences between voluntary and involuntary blinks.
